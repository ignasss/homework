# Trading-Places

_This repository is for the Investment Management Technology assesments from September 2019._

This repository should contain:

* Trading Places Instructions.pdf
* TradingPlaces/ (C# Solution)

## Instructions

1. Work within this private repository that has been created for you.
2. Open the instructions document which contains the code requirements to be added.
3. When finished, Upload/Push your changes to **this** repository (please do not add this code to your own repositories, or post it anywhere else). 

*Please include a commit message which makes it clear you are ready for your submission to be assesed, such as "Final commit, ready for review"*
## Notes and Hints

* This repository is unique to your application. You are provided with skeleton ASP.NET Core service to get you started and should concentrate on filling in the business logic rather than the hosting.  You should not need to change any of the existing code, however you are free to do so if you choose.
* Depending on your level of experience we would not expect the test to take more than a few hours, possibly quicker - you are free to spend as little or as long as you like on it. We do find it useful to know how long you spent - please include this in the text file noted below.
* Consider that the solution should be ready to go to production and be testable 
* Consider adding a short text file to the main folder explaining any assumptions or design choices you have made.
* Don't overengineer the solution - we are looking for appropriate use of the framework and appropriate use of hand crafted code.
* If you do choose to include an interesting technique or methodology you can just do this in one place for the purposes of time, and indicate that you would use it elsewhere if time allowed
